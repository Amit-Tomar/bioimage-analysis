Bio image analysis may involve operations like : 

1. **Pre-processing:** We convert the data into more usable forms. This may involve normalizing colors (eg. in case images are stained with different concentrations, different kind of scanners ) , re-orientation/registration for better alignment (different slices might require operations to be applied to align them as their correct physical orientations when they were part of single tissue   ) , reducing file size (for faster processing), background/noise removal ( for easiely extractable features) etc.

2. **Filtering/Segmenting: ** Extracting out the relevant structures (like cells) from the image.

3. **Analysing** Analysing the attributes of extracted structures (like area/volume), relations among them, properties of objects across images/over-time.

etc.
