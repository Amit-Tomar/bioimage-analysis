QuPath is open source software for bioimage analysis which is used for digital pathology ,specially whole slide image analysis.

## Color Deconvolution in QuPath
QuPath has the ability of digitally seperating out the various stain merkers (utpo 3) from the image. (An important distinction is that it is not just seperating the channels, rather deriving the stain colors from th e combinedcolors of image). Pressing buttons 1,2,3,4.. switches between these values. Using brightness/contrast buttons, we can also do the same operation along with changing the min/max values of the histogram distribution of each extracted layer seperately. 

## Cell detection
QuPath can run cell detection based on some user specified parameters like threshold intensity, area etc. 

## Object based classifier

## Pixel based classifier
