## Getting started

This book is a collection of resources I come across as I try to understand the area of bio imaging. This is basically me taking down the notes for same. It is focused on histopathology, but should be useful for anyone analysing other biological images in general. Content is curated from various video lectures/blogs/articles/papers etc. 

For editing this book/suggestions, please raise PR to the [Github repo](https://github.com/Amit-Tomar/bioimage-analysis/tree/master/index.md).
