## Getting started

This book is a collection of resources for someone starting into the area of bio-image analysis. It is specially focused on histopathology, but should be useful in analysing other biological images in general. For editing this book/suggestions, please raise PR to the [Github repo](https://github.com/Amit-Tomar/bioimage-analysis/tree/master/index.md). 

Bio image analysis may involve operations like : 

1. Pre-processing the data to convert into more usable forms (normalized colors, re-orientation/registration for better alignment, smaller file size, easiely extractable features, faster processing etc.).

2. Filtering/Segmenting out the relevant structures (and their attributes like area/volume etc) from the image.

3. Analysing properties of objects across images/over-time.

etc.
